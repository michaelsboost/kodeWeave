kodeWeave uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Codemirror](http://codemirror.net/) - Awesome web-based text editor
* [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) - Codemirror Plugin for Zen Coding
* [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) - Create .zip files using Javascript
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - Save files client-side in Javascript

Development
-------------

Building and maintaining software is skilled, specialized work. I prefer to allow the whole world to use my software, but I do need some kind of income.

Thus, I ask those who use my software to make profit to fund the production of that software. This is a social expectation, not a legal requirement.

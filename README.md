Tech

kodeWeave uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Codemirror v6](http://codemirror.net/) - Awesome web-based text editor
* [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) - Screenshots in Javascript
* [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) - Package zip files locally in javascript
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - JSZip comes prebuilt with this. Allows us to save files locally in Javascript
* [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/api) - Used to easily add the latest libraries and frameworks in the app by a single search
* [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) - Codemirror Plugin for Zen Coding
* [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Used to design the Application's interface.
* [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library used for the app's ui. (I did have to design the twitter logo icon myself though)
